# BEHealthy 

## Overview
BEHealthy is an advanced healthtech platform leveraging MLOps to provide scalable and efficient machine learning solutions for the healthcare industry. This project integrates cutting-edge AI/ML models with robust DevOps practices to ensure seamless deployment, monitoring, and automation.

## Features
- **Automated Machine Learning Pipelines**: Streamlined training, validation, and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and high-volume requests.
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)**: Ensures stable and rapid updates.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Real-time performance tracking and anomaly detection.
- **Security & Compliance**: Adheres to healthcare data standards like HIPAA and GDPR.

## Architecture
The BEHealthy MLOps system follows a modular architecture:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Secure and scalable data pipeline.
2. **Model Training & Validation**: Automated training with hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Model Deployment**: Containerized models served via REST API.
4. **Monitoring & Feedback Loop**: Continuous model performance tracking and retraining.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS/GCP/Azure
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, ELK Stack
- **Security**: OAuth2, SSL/TLS, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
